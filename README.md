# Academic-Involvement-Levels-Affected-by-Residential-Choices

Used Logistic Regression on American Time Use Survey Data to study the marginal effects, if any, of living off-campus on academic involvments.

* Examined time distribution of commuter students and traditional residents respectively
* Picked up six variables that may contribute to different academic involvement levels according to the percentage of time distribution and differences between two types of students
* Explored if commuting to school affects academic involvement levels. Then, figured out what independent variables intensify this relationship by logistic regression analysis.
